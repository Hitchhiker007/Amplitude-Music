## 🏗 Architecture

The system follows a serverless architecture on AWS:

```
React Frontend (Amplify)
        ↓
API Gateway (REST API)
        ↓
Lambda Function (Node.js router)
        ↓
DynamoDB (login + subscription tables)

Last.fm API ← called directly from React frontend
```

- The **React frontend** communicates with **API Gateway** using an API key for all authenticated operations
- **Lambda** acts as a single router function, dispatching requests to the appropriate service based on HTTP method and path
- **DynamoDB** stores two tables — `login` (users) and `subscription` (saved songs)
- The **Last.fm API** is called directly from the frontend to fetch scrobble data, avoiding unnecessary Lambda invocations for read-only public data
